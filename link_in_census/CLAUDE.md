# Claude Code Instructions

## Background on what we are trying to do

The goal of programs in this folder is to link people who are observed in the 1940 census back to observations before the 1940 census. In particular, we need to discern where they were living before they turned 18.

Code written here will then be run on a supercomputer on the full sample that is very large so please keep that in mind and optimize code to run well on large data.

## Output Directories

### Figures
All generated figures should be exported to:
```
/Users/cjwardius/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UCSanDiego/demo of education/output/figures
```

Make sure that the colors are consistent across graphs for given units. For example, if the graph is of regions, the regions should have the same color in a line graph for example regardless of the program.

### Tables
All generated LaTeX tables and statistical tables (for papers/reports) should be output to:
```
/Users/cjwardius/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UCSanDiego/demo of education/output/tables
```

## Output

Always make sure to run newly generated / modified code to make sure it runs and ensure that the output is consistent with the request.

## README file updating

Always make sure to update the read me file after making changes to the codebase so that it stays up to date.
