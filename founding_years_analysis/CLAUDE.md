# Claude Code Instructions

## Output Directories

### Figures
All generated figures should be exported to:
```
/Users/cjwardius/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UCSanDiego/demo of education/output/figures
```

Make sure that the colors are consistent across graphs for given units. For example, if the graph is of regions, the regions should have the same color in a line graph for example regardless of the program.

### Tables
All generated LaTeX tables and statistical tables (for papers/reports) should be output to:
```
/Users/cjwardius/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UCSanDiego/demo of education/output/tables
```
