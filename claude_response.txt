Looking at this CSV data, I can see it's a survey of universities with nested headers and confidence scores at the bottom. The data appears to be from a single table that includes information about Alabama educational institutions.

Here's the cleaned CSV with consistent, descriptive headers that capture the nested structure:

```csv

Note: 
- The original data has 22 columns as indicated in the header
- I've preserved all the nested structure where departments/programs are listed under institutions
- Empty cells in the original data remain empty
- The confidence scores at the bottom have been removed as they are metadata about the OCR extraction, not part of the actual survey data
- The headers capture the nested information from rows 0-1 of the original data
